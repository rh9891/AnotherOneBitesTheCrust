## Description

Another One Bites the Crust is an 80's-themed musically punny pizza making application that allows the user to create a pizza of their choice by selecting and submitting its ingredients. As the user creates their pizza, it will be displayed onto the page. The 80's could arguably be labeled as THE best decade for music, so the inspirations for punny pizza names (based on music titles) are endless!

## Acknowledgments

A heartfelt thanks to Github user, David Cox, whose helpful video tutorial I looked to for guidance whenever I found myself stuck, especially when building the structure of the ORM variable and creating the routes - the right way! - for the POST and DELETE routes.
