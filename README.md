## Description

Another One Bites the Crust is an 80's-themed musically punny pizza making application that allows the user to create a
pizza of their choice by selecting and submitting its ingredients. As the user creates their pizza, it will be displayed
onto the page. The 80's could arguably be labeled as THE best decade for music, so the inspirations for punny pizza
names (based on music titles) are endless!
